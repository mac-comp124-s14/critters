    //FOR JUSTICE!

/*
    A dashing hero flashing through the spaceways,
He's red and black and white and yellow too!
Justice is what he claims to fight for.
But it's a mystery - what does this 'justice' mean? He hasn't got a clue.
Those who think they can disturb the peace,
Get a taste of his space fury.
Protector of the universe, that is his destiny.
Go! Space Hunter - Drake Redcrest.
